## Quick Start

1. Install [ESPHome](https://esphome.io/) on your computer or Home Assistant.
2. Copy one of the example YAML files to your ESPHome configuration folder (no repository clone required):
   - [peopleCounter32.yaml](peopleCounter32.yaml)
   - [peopleCounter8266.yaml](peopleCounter8266.yaml)
3. Flash it with `esphome run peopleCounter32.yaml` (replace with your file).

For setup details with Home Assistant, see the [Home Assistant integration](home_assistant.md).

## Wiring

The sensors from Pololu, Adafruit and the GY-53 can also be connected to the 5v pin (VIN) as they have a voltage regulator.

If you use a GY-53, connect the PS pin to GND (Ps=0).

Ps=1 (default): Serial port UART mode, Pin3 is TX, Pin4 is RX, TTL level, PWM output works.
Ps=0 (when connected to GND): In the IIC mode, the user can operate the chip by himself. The module owns the MCU and does not operate the chip. The PWM output does not work.

## Configuration

### Platform Setup

Roode is provided as an external_component which means it is easy to set up in any ESPHome sensor configuration file.

Other than base ESPHome configuration the only config that's needed for Roode is

```yaml
external_components:
  - source: github://Lyr3x/Roode@master
    refresh: always
vl53l1x:
roode:
```

This uses the recommended default configuration.

However, we offer a lot of flexibility. Here's the full configuration spelled out.

```yml
external_components:
  - source: github://Lyr3x/Roode
    refresh: always
    ref: master

# VL53L1X sensor configuration is separate from Roode people counting algorithm
vl53l1x:
  # ID for this sensor when using multiple VL53L1X modules on the same bus
  sensor_id: 1
  # A non-standard I2C address
  address:
  # How long to wait for boot and measurements before giving up
  timeout: 2s

  # Sensor calibration options
  calibration:
    # The ranging mode is different based on how long the distance is that the sensor need to measure.
    # The longer the distance, the more time the sensor needs to take a measurement.
    # Available options are: auto, shortest, short, medium, long, longer, longest
    ranging: auto
    # The offset correction distance. Run [calibration/OffsetAndXtalkCalibration](calibration/OffsetAndXtalkCalibration)
    # with a 17% grey target 140 mm away and copy the reported value.
    offset: 8mm
    # The corrected photon count in counts per second. Use the same sketch in a
    # dark room to measure crosstalk and copy the result.
    crosstalk: 53406cps

  # Hardware pins
  pins:
    # Shutdown/Enable pin used to change the I2C address and recover the sensor if needed.
    xshut:
      number: GPIO3
      mode: OUTPUT_PULLUP
      ignore_strapping_warning: true
    # Interrupt pin with internal pull-up for the data ready signal
    interrupt:
      number: GPIO1
      mode: INPUT_PULLUP

  # When an xshut pin is provided the library will power cycle the sensor
  # automatically if a measurement times out.
  # On boot the driver checks that the xshut and interrupt pins work and
  # prints the result to the log.

# Roode people counting algorithm
roode:
  # Smooth out measurements by using the minimum distance from this number of readings
  # Increase to 4-5 if jitter is a problem; 1 is fastest but noisier
  sampling: 2

  # The orientation of the two sensor pads in relation to the entryway being tracked.
  # The advised orientation is parallel, but if needed this can be changed to perpendicular.
  orientation: parallel

  # This controls the Region of Interest. Adjust width/height a few steps at a time
  # when the doorway is unusually narrow or wide. The current default is
  roi: { height: 16, width: 6 }
  # We have an experimental automatic mode that can be enabled with
  # roi: auto
  # or only automatic for one dimension
  # roi: { height: 16, width: auto }

  # The detection thresholds for determining whether a measurement should count as a person crossing.
  # A reading must be greater than the minimum and less than the maximum to count as a crossing.
  # These can be given as absolute distances or as percentages.
  # Percentages are based on the automatically determined idle or resting distance.
  detection_thresholds:
    min: 0%  # default minimum is any distance
    # raise by ~5% or 50mm steps if door movements cause counts
    max: 85% # default maximum is 85%
    # an example of absolute units
    # min: 50mm
    # max: 234cm

  # Persist calibration data so thresholds survive restarts
  calibration_persistence: true

  # Jitter reduction options
  filter_mode: median  # min, median or percentile10
  # Increase the window to 7 or 9 for heavy noise, drop to 3 for faster response
  filter_window: 5     # number of samples used by the filter
  # Log interrupt fallback events and XSHUT recoveries
  log_fallback_events: true
  # Disable dual core tasking if needed
  force_single_core: false
  # Restart if readings are 0 or >4000mm too many times
  invalid_distance_limit: 10
  # Minimum time between automatic sensor restarts
  restart_timeout: 30s
  # Apply less aggressive filtering only when CPU usage is high
  cpu_optimization:
    activate: 90%
    deactivate: 50%
  # Event logs show xshut power cycles, interrupt fallbacks and manual adjustments

  # The people counting algorithm works by splitting the sensor's capability reading area into two zones.
  # This allows for detecting whether a crossing is an entry or exit based on which zone was crossed first.
  zones:
    # Flip the entry/exit zones. If Roode seems to be counting backwards, set this to true.
    invert: false

    # Entry/Exit zones can set overrides for individual ROI & detection thresholds here.
    # If omitted, they use the options configured above.
    entry:
      # Entry zone will automatically configure ROI, regardless of ROI above.
      roi: auto
    exit:
      roi:
        # Exit zone height starts at 8. Change by 1-2 if objects are closer on this side
        height: 8
        # Additionally, zones can manually set their center point.
        # Usually though, this is left for Roode to automatically determine.
        center: 124

      detection_thresholds:
        # Exit zone's min detection threshold will be 5% of idle/resting distance, regardless of setting above.
        min: 5%
        # Exit zone's max detection threshold will be 70% of idle/resting distance, regardless of setting above.
        # Adjust these in 5% steps if one side sees false counts
        max: 70%
```

The `entry` and `exit` blocks allow tuning each zone when they behave differently.
For example, an entryway with a shelf on one side might need a smaller ROI or
stricter thresholds only in that zone. Start with small adjustments—change the
ROI height or width by one or two units or nudge thresholds 5 % at a time—and
test before making larger changes.
### Interrupt vs Polling

Roode prefers the interrupt pin for efficient updates. When `interrupt` is defined and validated, the VL53L1X notifies the MCU whenever a new sample is ready. If the INT pin is missing or stops working, Roode falls back to a 10 ms polling loop and tries interrupts again every 30 minutes. Polling also acts as a safety net during startup.

| Situation | Use INT | Use Polling |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Normal operation | ✅ | 🔁 (optional verify) |
| INT not received in time | ⛔️ | ✅ |
| Sensor just booted | ⛔️ | ✅ |
| Interrupt unreliable | ⛔️ | ✅ |
| Low-power mode handling | ⛔️ | ✅ |


### Single vs Dual Core

On ESP32 targets Roode tries to run the sensor loop on the second CPU core so
Wi‑Fi and other ESPHome tasks stay responsive.  If the task fails to start or
when running on an ESP8266 the code automatically falls back to a single‑core
loop.  You can force single‑core mode with `force_single_core: true`.

### Sampling and Filtering

Roode smooths distance readings in two stages. The driver first averages
multiple raw measurements using the `sampling` option. Each zone then applies a
filter across the last few averaged values controlled by `filter_mode` and
`filter_window`.

Raising `sampling` makes each reading steadier while `filter_window` dictates
how many of those readings must agree before an event fires. Because the filter
operates on averaged data, the total number of raw readings considered is
`sampling` multiplied by `filter_window`. This gives better noise rejection at
the cost of reaction speed. Start with `sampling: 2` and `filter_window: 3` and
increase them together if your environment is unstable. See the table below for
how the available filter modes behave.

| Mode | When to use | Pros | Cons |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `min` | Very clean environments or quick response needed | Reacts instantly to changes | Sensitive to noise and outliers |
| `median` | General use when noise is moderate | Ignores spikes for stable readings | Can lag behind fast motion |
| `percentile10` | Noisy locations where some jitter must be ignored | Balances responsiveness and noise rejection | Slightly less stable than median |

#### `sampling`

*Averages consecutive raw measurements before filtering.* Increase above `2` only when noise causes flickering.

**Recommended values** moved to the Quick Tips section below.

#### `filter_window`

*Number of past measurements considered by the filter.* `3` is responsive, while `5+` helps in harsh lighting or reflective areas.

**Recommended values** moved to the Quick Tips section below.

Filter mode tips: use `median` to ignore spikes or `percentile10` for gradual noise.

### Quick Tips Summary

The two settings work together: a window of `3` with `sampling: 2` means each
reported value reflects six raw readings. Raise both when sunlight or
reflections cause false triggers.

#### Sampling

| `sampling` | When to use | Tradeoff |
| ---------- | ---------- | -------- |
| `1` | Fastest response, low noise | Higher noise |
| `2–3` | Balanced stability and speed | Slight delay |
| `4+` | Very noisy or unstable areas | Noticeable lag |

#### Filter Window

| `filter_window` | When to use | Tradeoff |
| --------------- | ---------- | -------- |
| `3` | General smoothing | Slightly slower response |
| `5+` | Suppress false triggers | Laggy detection |
| `1` | Maximum responsiveness | No noise rejection |

## Multi-Sensor Notes

- Use one `vl53l1x` block per sensor; assign each a unique I²C address.
- Wire XSHUT for every sensor so the driver can isolate peers while changing addresses; it already sequences XSHUT during setup.
- Prefer separate INT pins per sensor; default polarity is active-low (INPUT_PULLUP). If you set INPUT_PULLDOWN, the driver assumes active-high.
- Keep I2C at 400 kHz; for multiple sensors on longer runs ensure proper pull-ups and avoid mixing long ribbon cables without buffering.

### Sensors

#### People Counter

The most important one is the people counter.

```yaml
number:
  - platform: roode
    people_counter:
      name: People Count
```

Regardless of how close we can get, people counting will never be perfect.
This allows the current people count to be adjusted easily via Home Assistant.

### Threshold distance

A crossing is detected when the measured distance for a zone falls between its
configured minimum and maximum values. Roode determines starting thresholds
automatically: after powering up, leave the area clear for about 10&nbsp;seconds so
the idle distance can be measured. The default maximum threshold is 80&nbsp;% of this
resting value.



To fine-tune detection, adjust the `detection_thresholds` option in your YAML or call the `recalibrate` service to re-measure the idle distance.

By default, the sensor calculates thresholds after startup by sampling the idle distance for about 10 seconds. The maximum threshold is set to 80% of this distance and the minimum to 15%. These can be changed at runtime using the `set_entry_threshold_percentages()` and `set_exit_threshold_percentages()` methods.

If you install the sensor \~20 cm above a door and want to ignore door movements, you might lower the minimum threshold:

```yaml
detection_thresholds:
  min: 10%
  max: 80%
```

Or in code:

```cpp
set_entry_threshold_percentages(10, 80);
```

This ensures movements too close to the sensor (like door leaf motion) are filtered out while still detecting people passing underneath.




See the [calibration instructions](calibration/) for further details.

## Algorithm

The implemented algorithm is an improved version of my own implementation which checks the direction of a movement through two defined zones. ST implemented a nice and efficient way to track the path from one to the other direction. I migrated the algorithm with some changes into the Roode project.
The concept of path tracking is the detection of a human:

- In the first zone only
- In both zones
- In the second zone only
- In no zone

That way we can ensure the direction of movement.

The sensor creates a 16x16 grid and computes the final distance by averaging all the values in that grid.
We are defining two different Region of Interest (ROI) inside this grid. Then the sensor will measure the two distances in the two zones and will detect any presence and tracks the path to receive the direction.

However, the algorithm is very sensitive to the slightest modification of the ROI, regarding both its size and its positioning inside the grid.

STMicroelectronics defines default values for these parameters as follows:

The center of the ROI you set is based on the table below and the optical center has to be set as the pad above and to the right of your exact center:

Set the center SPAD of the region of interest (ROI)
based on VL53L1X_SetROICenter() from STSW-IMG009 Ultra Lite Driver

ST user manual [UM2555](https://www.st.com/resource/en/user_manual/um2555-ultralite-driver-for-vl53l1x.pdf) explains ROI selection in detail, so we recommend
reading that document carefully. Here is a table of SPAD locations from
UM2555 (199 is the default/center):

This table is oriented as if looking into the front of the sensor (or top of
the chip). SPAD 0 is closest to pin 1 of the VL53L1X, which is the corner
closest to the VDD pin on the Pololu VL53L1X carrier board:

```
  +--------------+
  |             O| GPIO1
  |              |
  |             O|
  | 128    248   |
  |+----------+ O|
  ||+--+  +--+|  |
  |||  |  |  || O|
  ||+--+  +--+|  |
  |+----------+ O|
  | 120      0   |
  |             O|
  |              |
  |             O| VDD
  +--------------+
```

However, note that the lens inside the VL53L1X inverts the image it sees
(like the way a camera works). So for example, to shift the sensor's FOV to
sense objects toward the upper left, you should pick a center SPAD in the lower right.

## Features

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Path tracking algorithm | Distinguishes entry vs exit by tracking the order of zone crossings |

| Clean shutdown | Memory and sensor power managed on reboot |
| Startup pin test | Logs and disables features if xshut or interrupt pins fail |
| Built-in pull-ups | XSHUT and interrupt pins use internal pull-ups, no resistors needed |
| Metrics sensors | Optional sensors report loop time, CPU usage, RAM and flash usage |
| Fail-safe recalibration | Triggers recalibration if a zone stays active too long |
| Persistent calibration | Calibration data can persist in flash across reboots |
| Dual-core tasking | Keeps polling responsive on ESP32 with automatic retry/fallback |
| Filtering options | Median/percentile filters smooth jitter with adjustable window |
| FSM timeouts | Resets the state machine when a transition stalls |
| CPU optimizations | Automatic optimizations when CPU usage exceeds 90% |
| Interrupt fallback | Interrupt mode with graceful fallback to polling and logs |

| Feature text sensor | Reports enabled and fallback features for diagnostics |
| Manual adjustment counter | Tracks user corrections to the people count |
| Diagnostic sensors | Report INT/XSHUT pin states and other metrics |
| Zone presence sensors | Optional binary sensors report occupancy in entry and exit zones |
| ESP32 watchdog keepalive | Dedicated task feeds the watchdog and restarts hung sensors |
| Polling timeout recovery | Restarts the sensor if no data arrives for `restart_timeout` |
| Consecutive failure counter | Soft-resets the sensor after 10 read errors |
| Consecutive invalid distance recovery | Restarts the sensor after too many suspect readings |
| Recovery cooldown | Prevents another restart for `restart_timeout` |
| Sensor status reporting | Text sensor shows `ok`, `timeout`, `reinitializing`, `error` or `offline` |
| Event logging | Logs sensor power cycles, fallback reasons, and manual adjustments |
| Colored logs | Normal info in green, details in yellow, failures in red |

## Logging and Diagnostics

Roode prints key events to the ESPHome logger. Set `log_fallback_events: true`
in the `roode:` section to include interrupt fallbacks and XSHUT recovery
details. Event logs cover power cycles of the sensor, automatic changes between
interrupt and polling mode, and manual adjustments to the people count.

### Feature text sensor

The `enabled_features` text sensor summarizes which runtime features are active.
Typical values include `dual_core` or `single_core`, `xshut` or `no_xshut`, and
`interrupt` or `polling`. This helps verify that the hardware pins and options
are detected correctly.

### Diagnostic sensors

Optional sensors provide insight into Roode's operation:

- `loop_time`, `cpu_usage`, `ram_free` and `flash_free` report resource usage.
- `sensor_status` and `interrupt_status` show the current hardware state. The
  status sensor reports `ok`, `timeout`, `reinitializing`, `error` or `offline`
  so automations can react to issues.
- `version`, `entry_exit_event` and `enabled_features` provide diagnostic text,
  and a text-sensor `sensor_status` exposes the same status string.
- ROI size and threshold sensors allow live tuning of each zone.
- `manual_adjustment_count` records people-count corrections.
- The sensor automatically restarts if polling stops for the configured `restart_timeout`
  or after 10 consecutive read errors. All restart triggers share this cooldown.

See [extra_sensors_example.yaml](extra_sensors_example.yaml) for how to enable
these sensors.


## FAQ/Troubleshoot

**Question:** Why is the Sensor not measuring the correct distances?

**Answer:** This can happen in various scenarios. I try to list causes sorted by likelihood

1. You did not remove the protection film (most times its yellow)
2. You did not connect the Sensor properly
3. Light interference (You will see a lot of noise)
4. Bad connections

**Question:** The counter counts backwards.

**Answer:** Set `zones.invert: true` or rotate the sensor so entry and exit zones match your doorway, then recalibrate.
